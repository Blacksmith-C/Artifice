# Artifice
Learning C++ by trying to build a 3D engine

Artifice is intended to be both a learning experience and a dream project for myself. By building an engine from the ground up, I
intend to be able to rigorously understand the computer science which underlies the higher level functionality, so that I never
feel blindsided by the behavior of the engine I'm working in. Never is a strong word, though. I don't believe this will be perfect,
and it will probably be ugly to start off, but if I am able to find the time and the resolve to continue this work for years to come,
I intend this to be a quality product. 

The extremely lofty longterm ambition of Artifice is to create a FOSS 3D game engine in C++ which handles assets and scripts in a
modular fashion, so that every element of the gameplay is customizeable and accessible to modders. The end product should include
an in-game tree of all loadable modules, which can be enabled or disabled individually (or in groups in the case of dependencies).
Alternatively, explicit module lists can be selected, enabling and disabling modules en masse to essentially switch between entirely
different games on the same engine.

Artifice is not intended to be technically impressive, instead intentionally limited to a 5th console generation early 3D style,
for both aesthetic purposes and resource efficiency. Multiple different gameplay styles should be enabled by the modular design of
Artifice, so rather than paint a picture of the desired final gameplay, I will list the games which have been the most influential
on me and my dreams of developing games myself, in some particular order:
